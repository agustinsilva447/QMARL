DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_add_temp output design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_add_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_mul_temp output design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_mul_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_add_temp multiplier stage design_1_i/complex_mult_fixpt_0/U0/complex_mult_fixpt_add_temp/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>
