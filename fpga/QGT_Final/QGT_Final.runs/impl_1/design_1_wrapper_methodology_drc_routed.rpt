TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -34.789 ns between design_1_i/comblock_0/U0/comblock_i/regs_out_reg[0][2]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/comblock_0/U0/AXIL_inst/axi_rdata_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
