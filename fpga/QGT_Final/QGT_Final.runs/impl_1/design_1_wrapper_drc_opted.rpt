DSP design_1_i/QGT_state_fixpt_0/U0/arg__54 multiplier stage design_1_i/QGT_state_fixpt_0/U0/arg__54/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.
